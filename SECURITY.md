## Reporting a Vulnerability

This section is about how to report a vulnerability.

The visualcrossing.com and airlabs.co sites, used for this app, contain limitations concerning data withdrawal. Only a certain number of API calls are granted for a free plan.
Because this project is not a commercial one, but only for demonstration purposes, therefore, you might want to reduce a number of cities/airports in order to get 
the data quickly and without any restrictions. For a bigger amount of flights or excessive weather data, the FastAPI and Dash might need some adaptation.
