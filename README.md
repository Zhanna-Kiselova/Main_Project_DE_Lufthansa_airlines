# Main_Project_DE_Lufthansa_airlines

1) Project summary :
  The main project as a summary and final work for the data engineering learning program with the objective to expose the real-time international passenger flights of the Lufthansa group on an interactive map.
  Personal ideas are welcome and the application will propose some useful information about the current local airport weather as well as severe weather alerts worldwide in order to prevent the planes from flying over the 
  dangerous zones and avoid possible plane accidents. 

2) Utility of the project : 
  Another part of the application will be dedicated to interactive data visualization trough graphs and statistical dashboards. One of the statistics to present is about the airplane crashes. In order to propose 
  maximum security and avoid any type of accidents, it is important to understand the cause of these consequences. This information can be interesting and be destinated to : 
  - passengers/clients to have a quick analysis on companies, which have the least accidents, therefore the safest 
  - airline companies in order to understand better the problems of these accidents and avoid as much as possible in the future.  

3) The project is a final work and is due on August, 2023:
  After this date, any exterior suggestions or remarks are more than welcome in order to improve the project

4) For any help or contact, don't hesitate to get in touch. This project can be cloned and run with python3 main.py 
   
5) This application is developped by @IToubol & @Zhanna-Kiselova. It will be presented and visualized via the tool Dash. The final project completion is scheduled for August, 2023.
