Main Project : DST Lufthansa Airlines 

Project summary : The main project as a result and final work of the data engineering learning program with the objective to expose the real-time international passenger flights of the Lufthansa group on an interactive map. Personal ideas are welcome and the application will propose some useful information about the current local weather as well as severe weather alerts worldwide in order to anticipate the planes flying over the dangerous zones, therefore avoiding or decreasing possible plane accidents.

Utility of the project : Another part of the application will be dedicated to interactive data visualization through graphs and statistical dashboards. One of the statistics to present is about the airplane crashes. In order to propose maximum security and avoid any type of accidents, it is important to understand the cause of these consequences. This information can be interesting and be destinated to :

- passengers/clients to have a quick analysis on companies, which have the least/the most number of accidents and their analyse the causes 
- airline companies in order to better understand the problems of these accidents and take decisions for improvement.

Any exterior suggestions or remarks are more than welcome in order to improve this project. For any help or contact, don't hesitate to get in touch. 

This project can be cloned and run with docker-compose up in a terminal and can be visualized in the browser : http://localhost:8051

This application is developped by @IToubol & @Zhanna-Kiselova.
