There is a high potential for near record high temperatures
soaring into the upper 70s and 80s throughout the Panhandle
starting Thursday and continuing through Sunday. Friday will be
the warmest day with a greater than 80 percent chance of communities
seeing greater than 75 degrees. Warmest temperatures will occur
across the far southern Panhandle and communities located further
from coastal waters. There is a greater than 90 percent chance
that far southern communities such as Ketchikan and Hyder will
see temperatures greater than 80 degrees.
There will be some variability in high temperatures due to local
afternoon seabreezes and any low stratus that forms during the
overnight hours along coastal communities.
Remember, as temperatures warm and fuels become dry, there will
be an increased fire risk. To minimize impacts of the heat wave,
locate fans for cooling; wear light- colored and loose fitting
clothes; drink plenty of fluids, apply sun protection, and take
breaks if you must be outdoors for extended periods; do not leave
young children and pets unattended in closed vehicles; and plan to
check on the elderly, and neighbors who could be more vulnerable.",11.2

A multi-day heat event continues.

Maximum temperatures:
29 to 32 degrees Celsius 
 
Minimum temperatures:
18 to 21 degrees Celsius

Humidex:
37 to 40

Timing:
Today. 
Temperatures will be several degrees cooler on Friday.

Discussion:
Areas near the lakes could be slightly cooler than regions further inland.

Hot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.

###

Extreme heat affects everyone.

The risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.

Watch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.

Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.

A multi-day heat event continues.

Maximum temperatures:
29 to 32 degrees Celsius 
 
Minimum temperatures:
18 to 21 degrees Celsius

Humidex:
37 to 40

Timing:
Today. 

Discussion:
Areas near the lakes could be slightly cooler than regions further inland.
Conditions will start to improve from west to east this afternoon with the passage of the cold front.

Hot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.

###

Extreme heat affects everyone.

The risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.

Watch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.

Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.

A multi-day heat event continues.

Maximum temperatures:
29 to 33 degrees Celsius 
 
Minimum temperatures:
18 to 21 degrees Celsius 

Humidex:
37 to 40

Timing:
Today through Friday.

Discussion:
Areas near the lakes could be slightly cooler than regions farther inland. 
Friday is expected to remain humid. Daytime highs are forecast to be near 28°C with humidex values near 37.

Hot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.

###

Extreme heat affects everyone.

The risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.

Watch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.

Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.

A multi-day heat event continues.

Maximum temperatures:
29 to 32 degrees Celsius 
 
Minimum temperatures:
18 to 21 degrees Celsius

Humidex:
37 to 40

Timing:
Today. 

Discussion:
Areas near the lakes could be slightly cooler than regions further inland.
Conditions will start to improve from west to east this afternoon with the passage of the cold front.

Hot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.

###

Extreme heat affects everyone.

The risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.

Watch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.

Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.

A multi-day heat event continues.

Maximum temperatures:
29 to 33 degrees Celsius 
 
Minimum temperatures:
18 to 21 degrees Celsius 

Humidex:
37 to 40

Timing:
Today through Friday.

Discussion:
Areas near the lakes could be slightly cooler than regions farther inland. 
Friday is expected to remain humid. Daytime highs are forecast to be near 28°C with humidex values near 37.

Hot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.

###

Extreme heat affects everyone.

The risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.

Watch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.

Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.

A multi-day heat event continues.

Maximum temperatures:
29 to 32 degrees Celsius 
 
Minimum temperatures:
18 to 21 degrees Celsius

Humidex:
37 to 40

Timing:
Today. 

Discussion:
Areas near the lakes could be slightly cooler than regions further inland.
Conditions will start to improve from west to east this afternoon with the passage of the cold front.

Hot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.

###

Extreme heat affects everyone.

The risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.

Watch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.

Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.

A multi-day heat event continues.

Maximum temperatures:
29 to 33 degrees Celsius 
 
Minimum temperatures:
18 to 21 degrees Celsius 

Humidex:
37 to 40

Timing:
Today through Friday.

Discussion:
Areas near the lakes could be slightly cooler than regions farther inland. 
Friday is expected to remain humid. Daytime highs are forecast to be near 28°C with humidex values near 37.

Hot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.

###

Extreme heat affects everyone.

The risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.

Watch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.

Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports using #QCStorm.
